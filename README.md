# AsciiArt
## By: Jordan Cutler

This program allows you to enter an image and convert it to grayscale.
You can see an example from the grayscale.jpg image in the repository.
Some URLs seem to work but others don't.

To try it out:

`git clone https://github.com/lehighjcut/AsciiArt.git`

Make sure you have the latest version of sbt installed.

`cd AsciiArt`
`sbt run`

For a working image: try it with Game-of-Thrones.jpeg

Type in the prompt:
`Game-of-Thrones.jpeg`
